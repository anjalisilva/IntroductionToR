# Description

This course is designed for students who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career. The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Students will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, make a Shiny app, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, students will create R Projects.

---

# Learning Outcomes

* Setting up and using R and RStudio.
* Manipulating and visualizing data.
* Fixing errors.
* Understanding consent in data-based studies.
* Making presentations and managing projects.

Students must have internet connection and a computer with a microphone and required sofware implemented in order to participate. Keep microphones muted, unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking. Keeping your video on is optional, however, if you choose to leave it on, be mindful of what your peers can see. Course communications will take place via email. All course material will be available via IntroductionToR GitHub repository (https://github.com/anjalisilva/IntroductionToR).

# Materials

* Learners must have internet connection and a computer with a microphone in order to participate in online activities. 

* Learners must have R (http://www.r-project.org/).

* Learners must have RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/).

* Screen space can be a limitation during online learning since you'll want to see the instructor's screen and have your RStudio open so that you can type along. If you have access to a second monitor or a larger tablet to attend the course while keeping your laptop screen available for coding - this would be great! If not - don't worry, we'll manage!

# Course Policies

## Course Expectations
-   The course will include mainly live-coding classes. Students are expected to follow along with the coding. Be mindful of online fatigue. Be respectful and only one speaker at a time. Keep yourself on mute, unless you need to speak or ask a question. If you have a question, use raise hand feature. First say your name, then ask the question. If you have a question, you may type it to chat as well.

-   Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. We are dedicated to providing an accessible learning environment for all. Please notify in advance of the course start date if you require any accommodations or if there is anything we can do to make this workshop more accessible to you.

# What is R?

* A language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.

* R was initially written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman.

* Since mid-1997, the R Core Team modify the R source.

* R runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS.

* R is designed with interactive data exploration in mind.

* A version of R is released each year. Current release is 4.2.0.

## Further Reading 

*  Ihaka,R. and Gentleman,R. (1996) R: a language for data analysis and graphics. *J. Comput. Graph. Statist.*, 5, 299–314.

---

# Why R?

* R is open source and free.

* R has a community.

* With R, you can share your data analysis methods in a reproducible way.

* Packages (more than 18 thousand on CRAN!) extend R's capabilities to provide easy ways to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

* R is one of the standard language recommendations for data science.

* RStudio makes it easier to do more with R.

# RStudio

---

# RStudio

* RStudio is an integrated development environment R.

* Not only for R, but can also use Python.

* Has:
    * A console
    * Syntax-highlighting editor for code execution
    * Tools for plotting, viewing history, debugging and workspace management
    
* RStudio contains many features that make the development process easier and faster.
