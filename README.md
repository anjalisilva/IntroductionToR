# Introduction To R

Welcome! The vast amount of data produced by evolving information technology requires tools and skills. Among the many tools, R is a free, open-source language and an environment that could be used for data sciences. This course aims to cover topics in R and data science, with applications illustrated via RStudio. This course is part of the University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute Professional Programming.

# Course Overview

## Description
The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Learners will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, make a Shiny app, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, learners will create R Projects. The second part of the course will cover the ethics of consent, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) training, and professional skills including presentation, project management, and data security. Finally, the course will conclude with an industry case study. This course is designed for learners who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.  

## Learning Outcomes
Learners will know how to:
  1. Comfortably access R, identify options for working with R, layout the purpose of using RStudio and R Projects, understand best R coding practices, and recognize where R stands among other data science tools. Further, learners will be able to navigate RStudio to write scripts, use different R data types and structures, use built-in R commands and accessing external functions via downloading R packages. This will be assessed in Assessment 1.
  2. Describe and define features of a dataset by applying manipulation and wrangling techniques. Learners will be able to access built-in R datasets and import external datasets into R to identify and describe data structures, apply manipulation techniques to reshape the datasets, detect missing values, clean data, summarize data, export data and report findings. This will be assessed in Assessment 2.
  3. Explain the strengths and limitations R workflows and analyses using concepts of reproducibility, bias, diversity, inclusion, ethical considerations, equity concepts, data security and best coding practices. This will be assessed in Assessment 2.
  4. Build a strategy for exploring data by designing functions that can take data as input, perform simple analyses, and generate exploratory plots as appropriate for data type and story to be told. This will be assessed in Assessment 2.

-   Teaching Assistant (TA) for this is **Jessie Wang**, PhD student (she/her).For emails to the TA, use jae.wang@mail.utoronto.ca.

## Delivery Instructions
-   The course will be held over a period of 3 weeks, with classes taking place 3 days a week. Format will be online - synchronous via Zoom (Meeting ID: 248 642 5344; for passcode see email subject 'Data Sciences Institute, UofT â€“ Welcome & Pre-Class info'). All course material will be available via [IntroductionToR](https://github.com/anjalisilva/IntroductionToR) GitHub repository. If you experience issues with joining the live lectures, you must email TA and copy Instructor. Include the issue description, time, date (screenshot if available) to avoid loss of participation marks. Due to unavoidable circumstances, if the live (synchronous) lecture is disrupted or cannot be held, the instructor will upload the recording with an email announcement. It is the responsibility of the learners to view the recording.

## Course Notes
-   All course material will be available via [IntroductionToR](https://github.com/anjalisilva/IntroductionToR) GitHub repository. 
Folder structure is as follows:

     * **Assessments**: <br>
     This folder contains assessment files for learners.
     * Lessons-AllFiles: <br>
     This folder contains all files (Rmarkdown, slide-html, slide-PDFs, images, data, etc.) and is designed for the instructor. 
     * **Lessons-Data**: <br>
     This folder contains data only and is designed for the learners. Learners should download and copy this folder as 'data' folder within their R Project.
     * **Lessons-PDF**: <br>
     This folder contains slide-PDFs only and is designed for the learners. Learners should download the slides. Slides should be referenced before class to prepare or after class to review. During class, there will be mostly live-coding. The end of each slide deck will contain homework for that particular lesson. It is highly recommend that learners attempt these and attend tutorial sessions to seek help.
     * Lessons-Rscripts: <br>
     This folder contains R scripts used by the instructor. It will be udpated after each class and learners may download it for reference. 
     * Teaching-Notes: <br>
     This folder contains lesson plans only and is designed to guide the instructor.
     * README: README file.
     * .gitignore: List of files to ignore specified by instructor.
     
## Materials
* **Learners must have internet connection, and a computer with administrative privileges, a microphone, and all required software installed in order to participate in online activities.** 
* **Learners must have R (http://www.r-project.org/). We will help with downloading.**
* **Learners must have RStudio (Previously: http://www.rstudio.com/; now: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). We will help with downloading.**
* **GitHub account (https://github.com/).**
* Screen space can be a limitation during online learning since you'll want to see the instructor's screen and have your RStudio open so that you can type along. If you have access to a second monitor or a larger tablet to attend the course while keeping your laptop screen available for coding - this would be great! If not - don't worry, we'll manage!

# Course Policies

## During Class
-   The course will include mainly live-coding classes. Learners are expected to follow along with the coding. Be mindful of online fatigue. Be respectful and only one speaker at a time.
