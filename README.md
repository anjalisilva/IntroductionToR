# Introduction To R

Welcome! The vast amount of data produced by evolving information technology requires tools and skills. Among the many tools, R is a free, open-source language and an environment that could be used for data sciences. This course aims to cover topics in R and data science, with applications illustrated via RStudio. This course is part of the University of Toronto's Data Sciences Institute Professional Programming.

# Course Overview

## Description
The first part of this course teaches R with a focus on manipulating and visualizing data. Learners will get set up with a functional RStudio workflow, use different file types, transform data tables, import and manipulate data, use functions and loops, create data visualizations, make a Shiny app, and learn how to solve problems with their programming. Both base R and tidyverse methods are taught. To work reproducibly, learners will create R Projects. The second part of the course will cover the ethics of consent, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI) training, and professional skills including presentation, project management, and data security. Finally, the course will conclude with an industry case study. This course is designed for learners who have a degree in something other than Computer Science/Statistics who are looking to enhance their data science skills for their career.
